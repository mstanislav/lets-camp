Let's Camp
==========

Let's Camp is a RubyMotion iOS application to help with planning a camping trip. The application supports a few key features:
* An interactive map which sets a pin for your selected campground that displays in a variety of styles (traditional, topological, satellite, and hybrid)
* Campground search by state and campsite-style available (RV, Cabin, Tent, Horse, Boat)
* Food and Supplies packing lists with support for quantity; quick-reset functionality in the settings menu allows for easy mass-purging
